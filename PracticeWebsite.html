          <p>Chewing gum is a soft stick designed to be chewed without being swallowed.
 Most recent chewing gums contain a gum base, various sweeteners, and other additives for various purposes.
 Its texture can be described as being similar to rubber which is due to ingredients.
 The earliest records date back to 1848, when American Indians would chew resin that was made from the sap of spruce trees.
 Gum has been argued to not be classifiable as a food because many of its ingredients have many use besides gum.
 However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided that gum does qualify as a food under the current definition.
 Chewing gum is considered to have a low nutritional value.</p>
